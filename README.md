# Shoppy Cart

behold! another half-finished ugly-ass coding challenge from a company I won't name but that you can probably figure out with detective work! this time I used React though!!!

## prompt

make a storefront/shopping cart with a bunch of requirements that I won't bother to list

## how to run it

you'll need node and npm installed! then:

```javascript
// install dependencies
npm install
// start the server, then navigate to localhost:8080 in you browser
npm run dev
// run the tests
npm test
```
